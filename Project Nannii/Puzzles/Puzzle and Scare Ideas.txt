~Quest: Unchained Melody~

The player is required to play a tune that he hears on a glockenspiel/music box. Trying to play the church organ will cause it to struggle to produce a sound. Attempting to investigate the maitenence hatch reveals that it has corroded shut. The player must a chemical solution to unstick the hatch. This can be done by collecting bile and aqua regia from the infirmary and combining them. After opening the hatch, the player finds either a quest item (doll/toy) or something morbid jamming the organ pipes.

Boo is that You?: Kid that creeps toward you when looking away and covers his face or turns around when looking at him, like Boo from Mario.
